  # configuration (see {Hwinfo}), including naming and driver information.
  #
  # Logical configuration, like TCP/IP or WIFI settings, are handled through
  # {Y2Network::ConnectionConfig::Base} classes. Actually, relationships with other interfaces
  # are kept in those configuration objects too.
